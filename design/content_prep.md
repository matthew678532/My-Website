# Content Preparation & Strategy

## Key Questions

- Who is the owner? What is important to me?
- Who is the audience? What is important to me?

| *Owner: Designer/Developer*																			|	*Audience: Students, Prospective Employers, Designers/Developers* |
| --------------------------------															| ---------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Need to showcase university work															| Need to see some examples of work/creativity from the Owner
| Need to showcase personality (Colours, themes, content, etc.)	| Need to be able to contact the Owner
| Highlight my interests, what am I specifically looking for		| Need to understand the purpose of the portfolio, and be inspired by it

## Features

- Navigation: project portfolio, about (keep brief), contact (email form, linked in, facebook, google, etc.)
- Project portfolio - A cascade of images to be clicked on for previewing? (Needs to be easily accessible, pop out?)
- About section placed after portfolio of work?, Let the work speak for itself. Have a bold image of me, with a blurb.
- Contact form - keep it simple, lightweight!
